I was much too ambitious this week.  I assumed that it would start on time (about 10 minutes late again), that Chrome would have been loaded as promised (it wasn't, but I have now discovered that I can load it with the general student password - amazing) and I decided to lift img element from the lesson 5 so they could finish on a high.  that might have been OK, but I chose to use placekitten.com for the pictures.  Once the first lovely little kitty was on a screen none of them took very much notice of what I was saying, so we never got to the class and id attributes (which will be needed for the first css lesson next week).

So I am about to edit the lesson plan to what I think will work better...
